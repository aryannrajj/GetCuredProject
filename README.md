# GetCuredProject

ABSTRACT
The purpose of implementing this application was to create a system through which a patient can easily compare, choose and make an online appointment with a doctor just by sitting at home. The second objective was to replace the manual file-keeping system with the online one.
This system is created by considering the “Trend of private clinics and covid situation” in the country. The online appointment system aims to improve the quality of medical care by bringing all doctors with specific specializations of the city to one platform, eliminating long waiting lines and time wastage.
The application was successfully implemented using famous technologies and famous programming languages. This application does not aim at targeting any specific group. Still, every individual seeking medical help can use this application, which is why the user interface is simple and friendly while making this application. Like all other applications, this application also has a client and server side. This application is designed using HTML, CSS, C#, .NET CORE Framework, and SQL.
For now, basic functionalities have been implemented, and we plan to connect pharmacies and laboratories to the system.
